Coding Assessment for Gloo, LLC by Alan Reiley

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.





## Initial Project Setup Notes:

- In Terminal, perform “git init” in folder to initialize repo for this folder.

- Using yeoman, use the Angular and Karma Generators to create a boilerplate AngularJS project which is testable via Karma.

- Used 3rd Party CRUD-based API called AngularJS CRUD that provides CRUD functionality via PHP and MySQL to your Angular app.

- Imported .sql data into a MySQL database on my hosting account

- Now we have persistent data for our list. 



## Installation:

- Upload folder and its contents to your web server.

- Create a MySQL database and import the .sql file.

- Grant full privileges for a single user to the new database/schema created.

- Open DB.php and change values to match the settings of your database and server.

- Ensure PDO is supported on your server since we use PDO (as opposed to mysqli) to connect to our database in the code.

- Point your browser to the URL of the app root folder and enjoy .

- To view the app already installed on an existing host, browse [here - http://www.coloradocomputerguy.com/gluon/](http://www.coloradocomputerguy.com/gluon/)
